Exploring the Yelp Dataset

Yelp is a business directory service and crowd-sourced review forum. That is, the business revolves around the connections made between the consumers who read and write reviews and the local businesses that they describe [1]. Since the company’s founding in 2004, it has grown to include 4.6 million active claimed business locations and 192 million cumulative reviews for those 4.6 million business locations [1]. 
Despite the simplicity of the service offered, there are many attributes tracked and related to each other in the dataset allowing a vast opportunity for data mining. 
Yelp.com has an extensive dataset gathered from their online review services, and Yelp has made this dataset available to students in the form of a contest aimed at encouraging students to explore their data and discover novel trends and relations among their reviewers and businesses. This contest has a cash incentive and is on its thirteenth iteration, ending in December 2019. 
Initially we set out to answer four questions based on the yelp database. Do external factors affect average yelp reviews, such as economic or weather data? Our findings indicate that economic data, specifically higher unemployment correlates to lower reviews.
An attempt to characterize potential pitfalls and areas of improvement based on user review information indicated certain trends such as one-star Chinese reviews tend to have the word ‘panda’ in them.
We also attempted to characterize and identify important aspects of businesses to a given regional population, in this case Phoenix Arizona. We discovered that one-star reviews tend to have more negative words, and five star reviews had a very large emphasis on excellent customer service.
Yelp users can also rate individual yelp reviews. A review can be selected as funny, cool, and/or useful. We determined, using an algorithm based on naïve Bayes theorem that cool reviews are slightly more likely to result in a review being deemed useful by other users. Should a review be rated funny and cool, there is an extremely high probability of said review being voted useful as well.


Application:
Our findings can be used to improve the capability of a user to have his or her review reach a larger audience. We have found factors of importance for particular restaurants that owners can focus on to minimize the potential for 1-star reviews. We have shown that economic health might be considered when determining when to open a restaurant.
